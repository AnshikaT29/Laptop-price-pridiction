 Laptop-price-pridiction
 
 Project Overview

This project predicts the prices of laptops based on features such as company, type, RAM, CPU, memory, GPU, and operating system. It uses Python and machine learning to provide accurate pricing predictions, helping businesses and customers make data-driven decisions.

Dataset

1,303 laptop records collected from Kaggle

Features include: Company, TypeName, Inches, ScreenResolution, CPU, RAM, Memory, GPU, OpSys, Weight, Price

Project Steps

Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized column names

Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables and optimized features for better model performance

Model Training: Built a Random Forest Regressor to predict laptop prices

Model Evaluation: Calculated metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² Score

Visualization: Compared actual vs predicted prices using scatter plots for insights
